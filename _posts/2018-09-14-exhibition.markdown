Manchester, UK @Castlefield Gallery<br>
Curated by Barim (Korea) & Castlefield Gallery (UK)<br> 
<br>
<br>
Castlefield Gallery, Manchester Art Gallery, and Manchester Craft and Design Centre present SUBI 수비, a programme in three parts located across the city of Manchester. The programme features artists, designers and makers from Korea and the UK working with or inspired by clay, its uses and materiality.<br> 
SUBI 수비 is presented to be timed with Asia Triennial Manchester, 5-21 October 2018.<br> 
The Korean word SUBI 수비 has a particular meaning in the context of ceramics, relating to the refining of clay; whether purifying the raw material or the processes needed to rehydrate and filter dried clay so that it can be reused. The SUBI 수비 programme has been informed by a series of international artist exchange residencies* that have connected the artistic communities of Manchester and the North West of England with those of Busan and Gwangju in South Korea. As a result, cross-cultural influences are apparent in many of the exhibited works.<br>
<br>
Artists: Sam Buckley (UK), Insook Choi (Korea / UK), Joe Hartley (UK), Eunji Briller Kim (Korea), Eunmi Kim (Korea / UK), John Powell-Jones (UK), Hyun Min Shin (Korea), Gae-Hwa Lim (Korea), Gyung-Kyun Shin (Korea)<br>
<br>
At Castlefield Gallery, SUBI 수비 brings together a diverse group of experimental artists, product designers and master makers. All are highly skilled as a result of either formal training, self-teaching, or passing down from one generation to another. They place great value on the transfer of skills, knowledge and ideology through objects and making, and see this form of exchange from one generation to another, and from one culture to another, as integral to creating and communicating the world in which we live. The exhibition will feature traditional ceramics alongside works which explore the materiality of clay with ceramic costumes, film, and sound. Visitors to the gallery will also be invited to add their own handmade clay objects to the exhibition.<br>

The work of Eunji Briller Kim combines traditional pottery skills with techniques and tools from other disciplines, including 3D printing, sound and digital technology. Kim first met Hartley and Buckley during their residency in Gwangju (Korea) in 2017. Following this, Kim and Hartley co-designed and delivered a series of public workshops at PLANT NOMA, Manchester during her residency in 2018. Members of the public were encouraged to pay close attention to the materiality of clay, for example using their mobile phones and other technology to listen to the sounds it makes whilst rehydrating, and testing its electrical conductivity at different stages of the drying process. During her residency Kim also looked into the history of UK ceramics, visiting the Manchester Art Gallery collection and Middleport Pottery (Stoke-on-Trent). Kim’s experiences in the UK have informed plans for the production of a new large-scale clay sculpture for the exhibition at Castlefield Gallery, which will echo her smaller fired works produced in Korea, examples of which will also feature in the exhibition.<br>
