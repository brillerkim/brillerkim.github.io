Based in Korea, Kim creates art works using clay and ceramic. Majored in fine art, she also learned traditional ceramic
making. She is interested in reinterpretation of ceramic in contemporary art. Combining ceramic/clay with other medium,
she creates narrative and context. As below, Kim creates a single form of clay/ceramic and transforms that form,
combining with other medium.
