2018년 7월, 바림의 기획으로 Artists’ Residency Exchange Programme을 시작, 
영국 맨체스터의 Castlefield Gallery에 파견되어 리서치 및 워크샵, 교류 전시에 참여했습니다. 김은지와 Joe Hartley는 맨체스터의 Plant Noma에서 일반인 대상의 워크샵을 시리즈로 
진행했습니다. 워크샵에 참여한 사람들은 흙의 물질성에 주목했고, 핸드폰과 다른 기술을 이용해 흙의
소리를 들어보거나, 굳은 흙을 다시 물에 녹여 전도성을 실험하며, 흙의 다양한 성질을 관찰했습니다.
한국 그리고 영국에서의 경험을 투영하여 김은지 작가는 전시장에서 큰 규모의 스컬프쳐를 제작하고,
작품에 황순원의 단편 “독짓는 늙은이”(1944)에서 발췌한 글을 일부 이용했습니다. 김은지 작가는 한국과 영국에서 전통적인 도자, 도자 장인, 도자기 기술의 전수 방법의 차이점과 비슷한 점에 관심을
가지고, 특히 영국과 비교해 낭만적으로 묘사되는 한국의 ‘장인 정신’과 자신의 작업을 연결하고자 
했습니다. (2018 바림 도록 발췌)<br>

Castlefield Gallery, Manchester Art Gallery, and Manchester Craft and Design Centre present SUBI 수비, a programme in three parts located across the city of Manchester. The programme features artists, designers and makers from Korea and the UK working with or inspired by clay, its uses and materiality.<br> 
SUBI 수비 is presented to be timed with Asia Triennial Manchester, 5-21 October 2018.<br> 
The Korean word SUBI 수비 has a particular meaning in the context of ceramics, relating to the refining of clay; whether purifying the raw material or the processes needed to rehydrate and filter dried clay so that it can be reused. The SUBI 수비 programme has been informed by a series of international artist exchange residencies* that have connected the artistic communities of Manchester and the North West of England with those of Busan and Gwangju in South Korea. As a result, cross-cultural influences are apparent in many of the exhibited works.<br>
<br>
Artists: Sam Buckley (UK), Insook Choi (Korea / UK), Joe Hartley (UK), Eunji Briller Kim (Korea), Eunmi Kim (Korea / UK), John Powell-Jones (UK), Hyun Min Shin (Korea), Gae-Hwa Lim (Korea), Gyung-Kyun Shin (Korea)<br>
<br>
At Castlefield Gallery, SUBI 수비 brings together a diverse group of experimental artists, product designers and master makers. All are highly skilled as a result of either formal training, self-teaching, or passing down from one generation to another. They place great value on the transfer of skills, knowledge and ideology through objects and making, and see this form of exchange from one generation to another, and from one culture to another, as integral to creating and communicating the world in which we live. The exhibition will feature traditional ceramics alongside works which explore the materiality of clay with ceramic costumes, film, and sound. Visitors to the gallery will also be invited to add their own handmade clay objects to the exhibition.<br>

The work of Eunji Briller Kim combines traditional pottery skills with techniques and tools from other disciplines, including 3D printing, sound and digital technology. Kim first met Hartley and Buckley during their residency in Gwangju (Korea) in 2017. Following this, Kim and Hartley co-designed and delivered a series of public workshops at PLANT NOMA, Manchester during her residency in 2018. Members of the public were encouraged to pay close attention to the materiality of clay, for example using their mobile phones and other technology to listen to the sounds it makes whilst rehydrating, and testing its electrical conductivity at different stages of the drying process. During her residency Kim also looked into the history of UK ceramics, visiting the Manchester Art Gallery collection and Middleport Pottery (Stoke-on-Trent). Kim’s experiences in the UK have informed plans for the production of a new large-scale clay sculpture for the exhibition at Castlefield Gallery, which will echo her smaller fired works produced in Korea, examples of which will also feature in the exhibition.<br>
